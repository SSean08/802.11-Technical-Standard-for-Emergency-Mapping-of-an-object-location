# 802.11-Technical-Standard-for-Emergency-Mapping-of-an-object-location
Future College Thesis; Probably going to use 802.11bf protocol
This project aims to use the IEEE 802 Technical Standards specifically the 802.11 standard for Wireless Local Area Networks
to identify an object, and calculate its exact location.
This project is initially thought to be used as an emergency tool used to:

Locate a missing person's exact location in a rubble caused by landslides, earthquakes.



Future amendments will be expected concerning the text and possible features that can be added, whether from its purpose or technical feautures.
